            Integrating             -> Working

        The method "OnEvent" can also handle some of these. If the class is registered with the machine registry.

        1. Connect with the batch system site to retrieve a list of all machines including their status.
        2. Iterate the Machine Registry (Method getSiteMachines) and change machine status accordingly.

        As described earlier, it also can be used to handle different tasks regarding the scheduling infrastructure.
